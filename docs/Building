# Build:

make all

# jpeg.l.bc is written to .libs/ -- at any point after building you'll need to copy this file to $ALCHEMY_HOME/usr/local/lib/


# Install:

make install

# You may then want to manually remove the .a and .la files added to $ALCHEMY_HOME/usr/local/lib/ as they're not valid alchemy library files
